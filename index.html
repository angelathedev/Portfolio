      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Angela McByrd! I am a current high school math teacher and aspiring software developer. I was born and raised in the beautiful, windy city of Chicago, IL. My determination, care, and creativity make me a special kind of mathematics educator.

      <a id = "About"><h2>About Me</h2></a>
      <p>After graduating college, I started teaching middle school science.  I have always had a passion for computer science. I started an after school club teaching students to code using <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/" target="\_blank">Codecademy</a> and <a href = "https://code.org/" target="\_blank">Code.org</a>. I am excited for the opportunity to apply some of the principles and concepts I have used in the after-school program. I love solving problems and I love working in a team environment so I am excited for the opportunity to work in web development, providing clients with services they need!  I have collaborated on curriculum in the past with my fellow educators.  I loved having the opportunity to brainstorm ideas, learn from one another, and create new things. I hope to provide future clients with web applications that are tailored to their desires and needs, specifically focusing on educational technology web applications.  I hope to also provide educators with detailed plans and a sense of assurance that they are receiving the best service with me. </p>

          <p>For this <a href = "https://github.com/angelathedev/Local-Library-Project" target = "\_blank">project</a> I built the algorithms to organize an online library dashboard that shows which books are currently available, which books are checked out, and other general statistics about the program. Although I built the algorithms, there is no existing web application for this project yet.  This was built as a project for my Thinkful Software Engineering program to test knowledge of Javascript foundations.</p>
